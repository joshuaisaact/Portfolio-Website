<p>As I dive into building my portfolio website, Iâ€™m torn between two extremes. On one hand, I&rsquo;ve come across some truly impressive portfolio sites that, while visually stunning, demand too much from their visitors. Take, for instance, a 16-bit SNES RPG-style portfolio I found, where visitors had to maneuver a character just to access sections like &ldquo;About&rdquo; or &ldquo;Projects.&rdquo; Cool? Definitely. Practical? Not so much. I think any prospective visitor should be able to get to the meat and bones of the content within 5-10 seconds of visiting your page. Nobody has time to play a game to read someone&rsquo;s career history, as impressive as that initially seems.</p>

      <p>It does look pretty cool though, I&rsquo;ll give them that</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, some portfolios were essentially glorified online CVs, stripped of any real personality or creativity. They get the job done but fail to leave a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave me? I want to strike a balanceâ€”creating a site thatâ€™s lightweight, skimmable, and easy to navigate but still bursting with personality. My vision for version one is a microsite thatâ€™s simple to explore yet comes alive with wild, esoteric themes and skins that users can select themselves.</p>
<h3 id="tackling-the-challenges">Tackling the Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, this approach brings some challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Bandwidth Management</strong>: Loading all the skins upfront isnâ€™t practical, but then how do I manage their loading without bogging down the user experience? Iâ€™m thinking some clever lazy loading might do the trick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skin Application</strong>: Implementing multiple skins means more than just a dark mode toggle. Iâ€™ll need several CSS files and a way to inject them dynamically into the DOM using JavaScript. Reverse-engineering dark mode logic could be a good starting point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Design</strong>: Iâ€™ll sketch out the initial design in Figma, focusing on a clean, adaptable layout that can work with multiple themes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The site must handle different display types seamlessly, regardless of the chosen skin. That means a lot of testing and tweaking across devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Art and Skin Creation</strong>: Iâ€™ll start with five distinct skins to give users a taste of the variety. These can be expanded over time as I refine the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Prompting</strong>: One big question remainsâ€”how do I make sure visitors know about the skin options? Iâ€™ll need some intuitive prompts or hints to encourage exploration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="initial-skin-ideas">Initial Skin Ideas</h3>
<p>The ideas for skins are coming thick and fast, but here are the first ones I plan to develop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Light Mode</strong>: The default view, minimalistic, easy-to-read, quick to navigate. I still want to have some small opportunities to surprise (click my profile picture on the home page if you haven&rsquo;t already!)</li>
<li><strong>Dark Mode</strong>: Sleek and modern.</li>
<li><strong>Ladybird books</strong>: An homage to the retro Ladybird books common in the UK back in the 90s. I learned to read with these, so there&rsquo;s something quite nostalgic about them.</li>
<li><strong>Retrowave/Synthwave</strong>: Neon grids and 80s nostalgia.</li>
<li><strong>Ceefax</strong>: A retro nod to early teletext services.</li>
<li><strong>Hand-Drawn/Notepad</strong>: Scribbles, sketches, and personal touches.</li>
<li><strong>Geocities/Early Internet</strong>: A throwback to the chaotic charm of the webâ€™s early days.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any thoughts, feedback, or generally want to give me a hard time about my design choices, please don&rsquo;t hesistate to contact me using the contact form on the site.</p>
