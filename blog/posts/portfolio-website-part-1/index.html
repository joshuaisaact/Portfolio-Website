<p>As I dive into building my portfolio website, Iâ€™m torn between two extremes. On one hand, I&rsquo;ve come across some truly impressive portfolio sites that, while visually stunning, demand too much from their visitors. Take, for instance, a 16-bit SNES RPG-style portfolio I found, where visitors had to maneuver a character just to access sections like &ldquo;About&rdquo; or &ldquo;Projects.&rdquo; Cool? Definitely. Practical? Not so much. I think any prospective visitor should be able to get to the meat and bones of the content within 5-10 seconds of visiting your page. Nobody has time to play a game to read someone&rsquo;s career history, as impressive as that initially seems.</p>

      <h4>It does look pretty cool though, I&#39;ll give them that</h4>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, some portfolios were essentially glorified online CVs, stripped of any real personality or creativity. They get the job done but fail to leave a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave me? I want to strike a balanceâ€”creating a site thatâ€™s lightweight, skimmable, and easy to navigate but still bursting with personality. My vision for version one is a microsite thatâ€™s simple to explore yet comes alive with wild, esoteric themes and themes that users can select themselves.</p>
<h3 id="tackling-the-challenges">Tackling the Challenges</h3>
<p>Here are some hurdles that I&rsquo;ll need to overcome:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How does the user switch themes?</strong> Does the whole page reload? Is each theme a separate site?</li>
<li><strong>What features do I want and need?</strong> What is the intial site layout?</li>
<li><strong>How do I make it responsive?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How many themes are a good initial number?</strong> Five?</li>
<li><strong>How will people know that the themes exist?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How do I ensure the blog will support all these themes?</strong> If I eventually end up with twenty themes, I do not want to manually test them all across every page of my blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to manage this project (and add some structure to my scattered thinking), I decided to create a Trello board, with each of these questions, so I could ensure that I processed each of them one by one, and made sure I thought about them properly.</p>
<p>Here is my Trello:</p>
<p>In the spirit of transparency, let&rsquo;s go through the first one together.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-the-user-switch-skins">How does the user switch skins?</h3>
<p>Bear in mind, for version 1 of my portfolio site I wanted to use a very plain tech stack, ideally with no frontend frameworks, so any native solutions they may have were ruled out.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for some time, I figured that I essentially had two options:</p>
<p>A single site, with multiple style sheets</p>
<p>This implementation would mean that all the different themes were loaded on initial page load, and as a user clicked change theme, it would trigger an event listener that would change the current active style sheets..</p>
<p>Pros<br>
Cons</p>
<h3 id="initial-skin-ideas">Initial Skin Ideas</h3>
<p>The ideas for skins are coming thick and fast, but here are the first ones I plan to develop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Light Mode</strong>: The default view, minimalistic, easy-to-read, quick to navigate. I still want to have some small opportunities to surprise (click my profile picture on the home page if you haven&rsquo;t already!)</li>
<li><strong>Dark Mode</strong>: Sleek and modern.</li>
<li><strong>Ladybird books</strong>: An homage to the retro Ladybird books common in the UK back in the 90s. I learned to read with these, so there&rsquo;s something quite nostalgic about them.</li>
<li><strong>Retrowave/Synthwave</strong>: Neon grids and 80s nostalgia.</li>
<li><strong>Ceefax</strong>: A retro nod to early teletext services.</li>
<li><strong>Hand-Drawn/Notepad</strong>: Scribbles, sketches, and personal touches.</li>
<li><strong>Geocities/Early Internet</strong>: A throwback to the chaotic charm of the webâ€™s early days.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any thoughts, feedback, or generally want to give me a hard time about my design choices, please don&rsquo;t hesistate to contact me using the contact form on the site.</p>
