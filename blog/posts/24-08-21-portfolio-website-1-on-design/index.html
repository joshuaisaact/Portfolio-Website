<p>As I dive into building my portfolio website, Iâ€™m torn between two extremes. On one hand, I&rsquo;ve come across some truly impressive portfolio sites that, while visually stunning, demand too much from their visitors. Take, for instance, a 16-bit SNES RPG-style portfolio I found, where visitors had to maneuver a character just to access sections like &ldquo;About&rdquo; or &ldquo;Projects.&rdquo; Cool? Definitely. Practical? Not so much. I think any prospective visitor should be able to get to the meat and bones of the content within 5-10 seconds of visiting your page. Nobody has time to play a game to read someone&rsquo;s career history, as impressive as that initially seems.</p>

    alt="gaming portfolio"><figcaption>
      <h4>It does look pretty cool though, I&#39;ll give them that</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, some portfolios were essentially glorified online CVs, stripped of any real personality or creativity. They get the job done but fail to leave a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave me? I want to strike a balanceâ€”creating a site thatâ€™s lightweight, skimmable, and easy to navigate but still bursting with personality. My vision for version one is a microsite thatâ€™s simple to explore yet comes alive with wild, esoteric themes and themes that users can select themselves.</p>
<h3 id="tackling-the-challenges">Tackling the Challenges</h3>
<p>Here are some hurdles that I&rsquo;ll need to overcome:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How does the user switch themes?</strong><br>
Does the whole page reload? Is each theme a separate site?</li>
<li><strong>What features do I want and need?</strong><br>
What is the intial site layout?</li>
<li><strong>How do I make it responsive?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How many themes are a good initial number?</strong><br>
Five?</li>
<li><strong>How will people know that the themes exist?</strong><br>
I mean seriously &ndash; what&rsquo;s the point otherwise?</li>
<li><strong>How do I ensure the blog will support all these themes?</strong><br>
If I eventually end up with twenty themes, I do not want to manually test them all across every page of my blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to manage this project (and add some structure to my scattered thinking), I decided to create a Trello board, with each of these questions, so I could ensure that I processed each of them one by one, and made sure I thought about them properly.</p>
<p>Here is my Trello:</p>
<p>In the spirit of transparency, let&rsquo;s go through the first one together.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-the-user-switch-skins">How does the user switch skins?</h3>

<p>Bear in mind, for version 1 of my portfolio site I wanted to use a very plain tech stack, ideally with no frontend frameworks, so any native solutions they may have were ruled out.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for some time, I figured that I essentially had two options:</p>
<p>A single site, with multiple style sheets</p>
<p>This implementation would mean that all the different themes were loaded on initial page load, and as a user clicked change theme, it would trigger an event listener that would change the current active style sheets..</p>
<h3 id="single-site-approach">Single-site approach</h3>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Instant Theme-Switching</strong><br>
Since all themes are preloaded, switching is immediate, with no delays or extra HTTP requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple Implementation</strong>  (initially)<br>
This approach is straightforwardâ€”basic JavaScript handles the theme changes, keeping things clean and minimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Backend Manipulation</strong><br>
Everything happens client-side, so there&rsquo;s no need to complicate things with backend logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Framework-Free</strong><br>
I can potentially deliver it without any additional front-end frameworks</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Slower Page Load</strong><br>
Loading all CSS upfront can slow down the initial page load, especially with loads of themes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher Bandwidth Usage</strong><br>
Users download all themes, whether they use them or not, which could be wasteful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memory Overhead</strong><br>
Stylesheets will all be loaded into memory at once, potentially impacting performance on low-resource devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance Complexity</strong><br>
Managing multiple stylesheets can get cumbersome, especially as the number of themes grows. There&rsquo;s a high chance of conflict, or interferance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capability constraints</strong><br>
If all the styles are pre-loaded, and done with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript on the same website, it means that I can&rsquo;t get <strong>really</strong> wild with new frameworks, technologies, and approaches (at least, not without really bloating the website)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multi-site-approach">Multi-site approach</h3>
<p>On the flip side, I could design it so that each theme was an entirely separate website, that a user would be redirected to every time they changed theme.</p>
<figure><img src="/Portfolio-Website/blog/posts/24-08-21-portfolio-website-1-on-design/oprah.jpg"
    alt="Oprah"><figcaption>
      <h4>You get a site! And you get a site! And you!</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimized Load Time</strong><br>
Only the necessary styles and assets load. This makes the initial load much snappier, as vistors only download what they need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Bandwidth Usage</strong><br>
Users download just one themeâ€™s assets, reducing overall bandwidth consumptionâ€”especially good for mobile!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolated Styles</strong><br>
Each theme is in it&rsquo;s own little segregated bubble, free from sibling rivalry. No more CSS conflicts!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simpler Maintenance</strong><br>
Each theme is a standalone site, so updates and changes are easier to manage without affecting other themes, leading to fewer headaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility in Design</strong><br>
Each site can have entirely different layouts or functionalities tailored to the theme, offering more creative freedom. I can have one theme be 3D, for example!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Slower Theme Switching</strong><br>
Switching themes involves loading an entirely new site, which means more HTTP requests and a less seamless user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased Complexity</strong><br>
Managing multiple sites can be more complex, requiring duplicated effort for content updates or changes across themes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heavier Backend Work</strong><br>
Depending on how itâ€™s implemented, this approach may require more backend logic to serve the correct theme, adding to server load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher Hosting Costs</strong><br>
Separate sites might lead to increased hosting costs, especially if each site requires its own resources and configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Experience Impact</strong><br>
Theme switching could be jarring for users as it feels like navigating to a completely different site, breaking the flow.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="so-what-did-i-choose"><strong>So, What Did I Choose?</strong></h3>
<p>After mulling it over, I opted for separate sites for each theme. Why? Because I wanted the freedom to get a little wild with design, without worrying about style conflicts or bloated code. Sure, itâ€™s a bit more backend work and might mean a bit more faff in terms of hosting and setup, but the payoff is a cleaner, more flexible experience. Plus, switching things up with a completely different look and feel just feels right.</p>

      <h4>The road ahead is long. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the end, itâ€™s all about giving each theme its own spotlight. Now, onto making those themes a reality!</p>
