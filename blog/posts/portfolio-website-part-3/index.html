       <h3 id="effortless-website-building">Effortless website building</h3>
<p>Problem space - lots of sites, hard to maintain across multiple skins, didnt want to spend ages routing, wanted tags.</p>
<p>When it came time to build the blog part of my site, I was faced with a few requirements that needed some careful thought. The first of which was how i was going to handle lots of continuously evolving blog posts, over multiple themes that may end up being mirrored on duplicate sites.</p>
<p>I initially considered an SPA approach, however i realised this would soon become cumbersome using vanilla JS, and would make for a very bloated html file.</p>
<p>Given that, I decided to go with an MPA approach. I also wanted features like tagging, inter-page routing, but most importantly, i wanted the ability to write blogposts in Markdown files, which could then be uploaded as websites.</p>
<p>Enter the Static Page Generator!</p>
<p>After doing some research I landed on Hugo, which is written in Go and is (supposedly) blisteringly fast, and well-supported in terms of templates and docs, and will automatically build a static blog site from a folder full of markdown files (and some html/css/js templates).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it went.</p>
<p>Firstly, i had to use homebrew to install Hugo.</p>

<p>This was painless, and set me up with a skeleton of folders that would be used to build the blog subsite.</p>

<p>My use case for Hugo was atypical - its most commonly used to launch an entire website, rsther than a sub-site. But it worked well.</p>
<p>I started out by building the empty template files - Hugo has a bunch of off the shelf themes, but given my main site was already built, i instead had to copy across the CSS and the existing header and footer html.</p>
<p>This gave me empty pages that shared the nav bar and footer from my existing site</p>

<p>the next step was to test it with some markdown files. I had a few blog posts prewritten on my phone (I try and write them on the tube as its a good distraction from the sauna that is the Victoria line).</p>
<p>Heres what it looked like:</p>

<p>Next step was to neaten up the CSS, fix the margins and general spacing. Hugo puts images in <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags by default, so these had to be fully themed.</p>
<p>The next step was integrating it with my existing site</p>
