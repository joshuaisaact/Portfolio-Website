To return to the main content, the user must engage with the modal by completing an action or by closing it.\nWhen I first conceived of my portfolio site, I spent a few days wondering whether I wanted to take a single-page approach, or a multi-page approach.",

      "content_text": "Design Philosophy As I dive into building my portfolio website, Iâ€™m torn between two extremes. On one hand, I\u0026rsquo;ve come across some truly impressive portfolio sites that, while visually stunning, demand too much from their visitors. Take, for instance, a 16-bit SNES RPG-style portfolio I found, where visitors had to maneuver a character just to access sections like \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Projects.\u0026rdquo; Cool? Definitely. Practical? Not so much. I think any prospective visitor should be able to get to the meat and bones of the content within 5-10 seconds of visiting your page.",
